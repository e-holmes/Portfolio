                                    I am Elizabeth Holmes. I am currently 21 years old and am working as an Operations Assistant at Lindamood-Bell
                                Learning Processes. My father was a software engineer and so is my boyfriend. I have always had a great interest
                                in computers. Most of my middle school career was used learning many different forms of computer arts. In high 
                                school I began learning how to build video games from YouTube videos and discovered my love of coding. I decide 
                                to begin making a career out of it in 2018 and took my first official computer science class. After discovering 
                                that I had no financial support to continue attending college I moved back to Washington and began learning coding
                                on my own through apps. Shortly after I discovered a program through University of Washington that would allow me 
                                to learn website developement in a short time period and at managable cost. I found myself much more drawn to the 
                                assignments that focused less on style and more  on logic. I am due to complete the course in Febraury 2020.
