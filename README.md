# Portfolio

This website was built to allow the viewer to get to know me and my work. It features some basic information about me, some of my past projects, and how I can be reached.

This website will allow any prospective employers or teammates to get an idea of my skill level and activities in coding. It allows grants a look into my past jobs through my resume and linked-in profile. So, whomever views it can have the most up to date information on me. 

The inital load will prompt the user to pick what they want to know first. By simply click one of the buttons you will be redirected to a page with information related to the buttons title. Done with a page? Simply select a new button from the bottom of the page and explore a whole new area!

If anything on the page is not functioning properly or if you have any comments on how it can be improved simply shoot me an email at beth.holmes@apples.com 

This website is maintained and created by me, Elizabeth Holmes, with contributions from Bootstap, Moment.js, and firebase.google.
